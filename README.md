# code-completion
Pytorch version of code completion with neural attention and pointer networks


## TO DO LIST:
- [ ] refactor preprocessing code
- [ ] add python to AST code
- [ ] config for preprocessing

## Requirments list:

- python3 >= 3.6
- torch >= 1.2, or tensorboadX for earlier versions
- pyyaml


## Instruction:

- run `python3 preprocess.py` for preprocessing
- run `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=id python3 train.py --config=path/to/config.yml` for training with specified config, list of available configscan be found at configs folder

## Results:
Here will be results on validation and pretrained models links !

## Examples:
Here will be examples of code generation
